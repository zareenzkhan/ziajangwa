# Background and Motivation
Our project is motivated by the following facts: 
- Flight delays are an issue for many business and official travellers. Airlines earn bad reputation for being unreliable due to delays. Based on the data, we want to explore whether these reputations are deserved. 
- There is extensive US official data on the topic of flight delays. For each of these flight, information such as date, weather conditions, airline carrier, departure and arrival airports are freely available.
- Numerous charts can be plotted to understand the statistics of airlines or airports to predict their performance.
