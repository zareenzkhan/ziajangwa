# Background and Motivation
Our project is motivated by the following facts: 
• Flight delays are an issue for many business and official travellers. Over the years, some airports such as Washington Dulles, DC have earned a reputation for being unreliable. Based on the data, we want to explore whether these reputations are deserved. 
• There is extensive official data on the topic of flight delays. More than 8 million commercial flights are operated every year in the US. For each of these flight, information such as date, weather conditions, airline carrier, departure and arrival airports are freely available.
• Numerous charts can be plotted. For example, what is the link between the political color of a given state and its performance against the national average in terms of flight delays? How about the relationship between airport location and city center (as given by Google Maps)?
